# Khmer Furniture
The mainly JavaScript commercial client-to-client web application project for selling second-hand furniture. This project is on experimental work for both Principle of Database Management and Web Application Development course at International University. The application is building on microservices architecture  using the most-modern technologies including ExpressJS, ReactJS and running Node environment.
<!-- ## Description
  Our software solely provides a platform for sellers, buyers, and advertisers to trade used furniture first in Vietnam, then proceeds internationally. We aim for direct usage of the app since the proposed customers range from 20 to 60 years old. The app is free, and there might be a paid feature that allows sellers and buyers to bump up their products and reach out to others. Also, our app makes money from an advertisement by displaying companiesâ€™ banners or events on the app itself.  -->
  
# Structure
The project was mainly separated onto two parts
```
|- root
  |- client: represents a React app for serving front-end side.
  |- server: represents a ExpressJS app for back-end side.
```
<!-- TODO: add more node description for details -->

# Installation
## Requirements
Before launch, there are few requirements for this project:
- NodeJS (>= v14) and npm
- MySQL database (this project built on MySQL v8)

## Setup and Launch
The setup idea is similar to any NodeJS server.

### Both front-end and back-end
- Clone the repository and install all dependencies for both front-end and back-end applications by using
```
$ npm install && cd client && npm install && cd .. && cd server && npm install
```
- After the installation was succeeeded, create a new database configuration by creating 
`./.env` file at the root of the project. Check out `./.default.env` for environment file template.

**[!] Ensure that** you are creating a database or schema for MySQL before run the application. Otherwise it will crash.

- After set up, run the application by
```
$ npm run start
```

## Configuration
Most of configuration was located by environment file (`.env`) in each front-end or back-end directory.
